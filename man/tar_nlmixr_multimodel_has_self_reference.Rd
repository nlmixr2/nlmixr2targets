\usage{
tar_nlmixr_multimodel_has_self_reference(model_list, name)

tar_nlmixr_multimodel_has_self_reference_single(model, name)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_list}{A named list of calls for model targets to be created}

\item{name}{Symbol, name of the target.
In \code{\link[targets:tar_target]{tar_target()}}, \code{name} is an unevaluated symbol, e.g.
\code{tar_target(name = data)}.
In \code{\link[targets:tar_target_raw]{tar_target_raw()}}, \code{name} is a character string, e.g.
\code{tar_target_raw(name = "data")}.

A target name must be a valid name for a symbol in R, and it
must not start with a dot. Subsequent targets
can refer to this name symbolically to induce a dependency relationship:
e.g. \code{tar_target(downstream_target, f(upstream_target))} is a
target named \code{downstream_target} which depends on a target
\code{upstream_target} and a function \code{f()}. In addition, a target's
name determines its random number generator seed. In this way,
each target runs with a reproducible seed so someone else
running the same pipeline should get the same results,
and no two targets in the same pipeline share the same seed.
(Even dynamic branches have different names and thus different seeds.)
You can recover the seed of a completed target
with \code{tar_meta(your_target, seed)} and run \code{\link[targets:tar_seed_set]{tar_seed_set()}}
on the result to locally recreate the target's initial RNG state.}

\item{model}{A single model call for the model target to be created}
}
\value{
A logical vector the same length as \code{model_list} indicating if the
model is self-referential to another model in the list
}
\description{
Does the model list refer to another model in the model list?
